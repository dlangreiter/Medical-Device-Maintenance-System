# Medical-Device-Maintenance-System
Developed a system for scheduling and tracking maintenance of medical devices, ensuring compliance with safety standards.

Skills: Python, SQL, Device Testing

Pooling my experience from my tenure as a biomedical trainee engineer at Royal North Shore to develop an integrated medical device maintenance system, improving on faults/errors and lack of UI efficiency found on their old system.

Tools and Frameworks:

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Database: SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Web Framework: Django, Flask (for backend), React, Angular (for frontend)
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes

Plan:
1. Requirements Gathering:
Identify key functionalities needed for the maintenance system (e.g., device tracking, scheduling, notifications).

2. System Design:
Design the architecture of the system, including database schema and user interface.
Choose frameworks and tools based on project requirements.

3. Database Setup:
Design and implement the database using PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Create tables/collections for devices, maintenance schedules, user information, etc.

4. Backend Development:
Develop RESTful APIs using Django or Flask for managing device data, scheduling, and notifications.
Implement business logic for maintenance tracking and compliance.

5. Frontend Development:
Develop the user interface using React or Angular.
Implement features for adding and managing devices, viewing maintenance schedules, and receiving notifications.

6. Integration and Testing:
Integrate frontend and backend components.
Perform unit testing and integration testing to ensure the system works as expected.

7. Deployment:
Containerize the application using Docker.
Deploy the system using Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.

8. User Training and Documentation:
Document the systemâ€™s features, usage instructions, and maintenance procedures.
Provide training sessions for users to ensure effective use of the system
